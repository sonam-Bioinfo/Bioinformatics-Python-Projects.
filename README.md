# 🧬 Bioinformatics Python Projects
Welcome to my collection of Python programs for DNA and Protein analysis! 🚀

## 📚 About This Project
I am a teacher and a learner exploring the world of Bioinformatics. This repository contains **12 Essential Programs** that I am building from my notes.

### ✅ Programs Completed:
1. **Hello Bioinfo** - Initial setup test.
2. **DNA Sequence Analysis** - Calculating length and counting bases (A, T, G, C).
3. **DNA to RNA Transcription** - Converting Thymine (T) to Uracil (U).
4. **GC Content calculation** -A program to calculate the percentage of Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) to determine DNA thermal stability.
